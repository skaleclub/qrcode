/**
 * queue.ts - The ONLY choke point that publishes Xphere sync jobs to QStash.
 *
 * v2.4 Phase 52 / FND-03: every Phase 52 producer wiring (onboarding, Stripe
 * webhooks, Connect, backfill) imports this one `enqueueXphereSync` function.
 * It publishes a THIN `{ tenantId, reason, eventId?, tags? }` message — the
 * worker (src/app/api/internal/xphere-sync/route.ts) fat-reads live tenant state
 * from it, so we never embed a stale snapshot in the queue.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN by design (mirrors the env-presence gate in rate-limit.ts):
 *   - Ships dark: when QSTASH_TOKEN is unset, OR no destination URL can be
 *     resolved (XPHERE_WORKER_URL / NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL both unset), the function
 *     is a silent no-op — NO publish, NO throw.
 *   - Observe-and-swallow: a publish error is logged and swallowed. This function
 *     NEVER throws into its caller. A CRM/QStash outage must never block
 *     onboarding or flip a successful Stripe webhook 200 -> 500.
 *
 * The publish target is resolved the SAME way the worker resolves the URL it
 * verifies the QStash signature against — otherwise signature verification fails.
 *
 * Code + comments in English. No barrel.
